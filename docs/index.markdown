title: "LIPS: Powerful Scheme based lisp interpreter in JavaScript"
---

## Features

* Literal regular expression.
* Asynchronous execution.
* Possibility to add new syntax (similar to Scheme vectors literals).
* Powerful introspection.
* Great integration with JavaScript.
* Auto formatting lisp of code (pretty print)
* Lisp and hygienic Scheme macros and macroexpand.
* Builtin help system.

## Installation

You can install LIPS from NPM (node.js package manager).
If you don't have npm you need to install Node first,
More information how to install Node in
[official docs](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs).

After you've installed Node.js you will be able to use NPM package manager, to install LIPS:

```bash
npm install @jcubic/lips@beta
```

I suggest to install 1.0 beta version, standard version is pretty outdated.

```javascript
var x = 10;
```

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  print "hello"
```
